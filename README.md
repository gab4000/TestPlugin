# TestPlugin
It's my plugin where I test Spigot's functionalities. It is a bit of a laboratory where I experiment with Spigot. This plugin will never be in final version (1.0). I will post releases to save ancien code but he will be always INDEV.
The plugin is currently in french. I plan to add a differents languages soon !
